# Maternal and Child Health Population Insights

This project was inspired by my article, Enhancing DHIS2 Data Analytics with Power BI. It brings technical concepts to life using a Population dataset extracted from DHIS2, then loaded and transformed in Power BI.

## Objective
This project aims to develop a comprehensive demographic dashboard to provide data-driven insights into maternal and child population trends and healthcare needs. This tool aims to empower healthcare stakeholders, policymakers, and planners to make better decisions to enhance maternal and child health services.

The dashboard will enable end-users to:

- Analyze population distribution, focusing on childbearing-age women and children under five (Total Population Under Five), to support targeted healthcare service delivery.
- Identify pregnancy trends to facilitate efficient resource planning for maternal health programs, and hospital capacity.
- Strengthen healthcare planning and policy formulation by providing insights for specialized interventions such as maternal care, immunization, and child nutrition programs.

The sql queries detailing the whole process from data cleaning to analysis is attached to the files.
